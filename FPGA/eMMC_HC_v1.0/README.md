This is the AXI SD-eMMC Host Controller IP Core repository
==========================================================
The AXI SD-eMMC Host Controller (HC) IP Core is SD/eMMC card communication controller designed to be
used in a System-on-Chip. IP core provides interface for any CPU with AXI bus. The communication between the MMC/SD card controller and MMC/SD card is performed according to the SD/eMMC protocol.

## Introduction
This core based on the "Wishbone SD Card Controller IP Core" project from https://github.com/mczerski/SD-card-controller
The core has been rewritten from Wishbone to the AXI interface and adapted to "SD Specification Part A2 Version 1.00". Major changes:
- Control register address map has been changed for almost all registers
- Data bytes alignment order has been changed
- Interrupt generation logic has been added for data and command layer

## Features
The SD/eMMC HC provides the following features:
- 4-bit SD card or/and  8-bit eMMC card mode (does not support SPI mode)
- 32-bit AXI Interface
- Interrupt generation on completion of data and command transactions
- Compatible with Linux distributed Arasan SDHCI driver, for 8-bit support needs to be added in "drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c#L3107" must set "mmc->caps |= MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA;"
